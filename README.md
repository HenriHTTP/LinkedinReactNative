# LinkedIn Clone

This project is a clone of the LinkedIn mobile app, built using React Native and Styled Components. The goal of this project is to replicate the look and feel of the LinkedIn mobile app as closely as possible.

The project is built using React Native, which allows us to write native mobile applications using JavaScript. Styled Components is used to create the look and feel of the app, allowing us to easily customize the styling of the app.
